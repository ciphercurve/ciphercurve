# Ciphercurve

**Open-source research & engineering lab based in Switzerland.**  
We explore and build at the intersection of **distributed systems**, **Rust**, and **applied cryptography** — with a strong focus on **zero-knowledge protocols** and **modular blockchain infrastructure**.

### 🧠 About

Ciphercurve is founded and operated by [Jonas Pauli](https://github.com/jonas089),  
a systems engineer and cryptography developer with **9+ years of open-source blockchain experience**, and over **3 years of professional Rust development**.

His work focuses on building foundational infrastructure in ZK, Blockchain interoperability, and next-generation consensus mechanisms.

We work closely with forward-thinking teams like [Timewave](https://github.com/timewave-computer) to push boundaries in proof systems and cross-chain infrastructure.
